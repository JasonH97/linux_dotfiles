# linux_dotfiles
My configurations for Linux systems, includes such things as .basrhc, .vimrc, neovim config, etc.
NOTE: I have opted to do a complete refactor of my neovim init.lua configuration, which will likely take some time due to competing with my actual work as well as other projects that compulsively come into my head
